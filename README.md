# discordbot
The discord bot will have 4 key features.

1) To send discord messages as emails
2) To receive emails which it then sends as a discord message
3) To keep track of everyone's schedule and send it via email or discord message upon request
4) Dinner feature which someone can set a time for dinner and the bot will notify everyone 10 mins and 5 mins before dinner time

The key problems:

1) Users have very different levels when it comes to tech abilities
      - Ideas:
      - commands must be simple and easy to understand
2) The the bot doesn't spam the email user constantly
      - Ideas:
      - possibly send one email a day with the contents of the day
      - send a email with the last 10 messages upon request?
